Zipc â€“ ZIP archive and deflate codec for OCaml
==============================================

Zipc is an in-memory [ZIP archive] and [deflate] compression
codec. Other compression formats in ZIP archives can be supported by
using third-party libraries.

Zipc has no dependencies and no C code. It is distributed under the
ISC license.

## Installation

Zipc can be installed with `opam`:

    opam install zipc
    opam install zipc cmdliner  # For the zipc tool.

If you don't use `opam` consult the [`opam`](opam) file for build
instructions.

## Documentation

The documentation can be consulted [online] or via `odig doc zipc`.

Questions are welcome but better asked on the [OCaml forum] than on
the issue tracker.

## Acknowledgments 

A grant from the [OCaml Software Foundation] helped to bring the first
public release of `zipc`.

The deflate compressor and general information about ZIP files
benefited from Hans Wennborg's thorough [article] about Zip files. The
deflate decompressor implementation started as a port of Joergen
Ibsen's [`tinf`] library.
