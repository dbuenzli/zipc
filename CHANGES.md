- Decompression limits in `Zipc_deflate` (breaking change). When the
  `decompression_size` argument of decompression functions is
  specified, decompression errors as soon as the decompressed size
  exceeds that value. Previously it was only treated as a hint.

- `Zipc.File.to_binary_string`, error if the decompression size starts
  exceeding `File.decompressed_size` rather than ignoring this value.
  This allows clients to enforce limits on the decompression of
  untrusted zip file. Thanks to Valentin Gatien-Baron for suggesting (#1).

- `Zipc.File.make`: fix default value of `version_needed_to_extract`. It
  was the same as `version_made_by` which is wrong. Now defaults
  to `20`(PKZip 2.0). Thanks to Valentin Gatien-Baron for the report (#3).

- Fix swapped date and time in the encoding of local file headers.
  Thanks to Valentin Gatien-Baron for the fix (#5).

- Write entries in the central directory in the same order as files
  are written in the archive. In particular this gives less
  surprising result on `unzip -l`. Thanks to Valentin Gatien-Baron
  for the patch (#2).
