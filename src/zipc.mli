      No effort is made to interpret relative segments correctly; a
      zip file with such paths is likely malice or clumsiness. More
      precisely this splits [p] on ['/'] and ['\\'], removes any
      ["."], [".."]  or [""] segment (in particular this removes
      absolute paths) and {{!String.concat}concatenates} the resulting

    {- If a path is defined more than once, the second definition takes

    container} constraint (you are however in charge of making sure
    this member is not compressed in this case).

(** {1:limitations Limitations}

    Up to the limitations listed below [Zipc] is suitable for the following:
    {ul
    {- Reading and writing the subset of ZIP archives defined
       by ISO/IEC 21320-1 which is used as a documentation container for the
       {{:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Open_XML}Office Open XML}
       or {{:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument}OpenDocument}
       file formats. This subset mandates only stored or deflate compression
       formats.}
    {- Reading and writing the
       {{:https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/#sec-zip-container-zipreqs}EPUB}
       file format which loosely refers to the previous standard
       in its definition. These may however be ZIP64 if needed (see below).}
    {- Reading and writing dozen of others formats that are based on ZIP
       like
       {{:https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/specs/jar/jar.html}
       [.jar]},
       {{:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Scene_Description}[.usdz]}
       (mandates no compression),
       {{:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole_Markup_Language}[.kmz]},
       etc. Note that these formats do not always formally restrict the
       compression formats but deflate seems to be widely used.}}

    It is not the aim of [Zipc] to be able to read every ZIP archive
    out there. The format is quite loose, highly denormalized, has
    plenty of ways to encode metadata and allows many modern and
    legacy compression algorithms to be used. Hence take into account
    the following points:

    {ul
    {- The current implementation is simple, it needs the whole archive
       in-memory for encoding or decoding.}
    {- The current implementation does not preserve the information about
       the order of files in the ZIP archive and generally writes members
       in the lexicographic order of their path save for the first one
       which can be specified with the optional argument [first] in
       {!Zipc.to_binary_string} and defaults to ["mimetype"]. This
       supports the {{:https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/#sec-zip-container-mime}
       EPUB OCF ZIP container} constraint which is the only format we are
       aware of that mandates an ordering in ZIP archives.
       A more general scheme (e.g. a  [Zipc.Member.order] property)
       could be devised would that be needed.}
    {- It handles only deflate and stored (no compression)
       compression formats. It has decent performance but if you find yourself
       limited by it or need other formats, third-party compression libraries
       can be easily integrated.}
    {- It is possible to rewrite an archive without touching or decompressing
       some of its members, however some metadata like comment fields may be
       lost in the process. See also {!of_binary_string}.}
    {- For now it does not handle ZIP64. ZIP64 is
       needed if your ZIP archive or decompressed file sizes exceed
       4Go (2{^32}-1 bytes) or if you need more than 65535 archive
       members.}
    {- It does not handle encrypted ZIP archives. Most standards
       avoid this anyways.}
    {- It does not handle multipart archives. Most standards avoid
       this anyways.}
    {- On 32-bit platforms one is severly limited by {!Sys.max_string_size}.}
    {- Compressed and decompressed sizes are [uint32] values in Zip archives
       but are represented by an OCaml [int] in [Zipc]. This is not
       a problem on [64-bit] platforms but can be in on 32-bit platforms
       and [js_of_ocaml] where {!Int.max_int} is respectively
       2{^30}-1 and 2{^31}-1. See {!Zipc.File.max_size} for more
       information.}} *)
